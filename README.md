# JQ: a Swiss-army knife
[JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is an amazing tool for manipulating JSON data (and some other kinds of data too!). I gave this presentation to my team at Lexy, who went on to use it in all sorts of incredible and creative ways to solve problems astonishingly quickly. Perhaps it'll be useful for you too, though the slides are a little bare. [Invite me](mailto:nornagon@nornagon.net) to speak if you want to know more :)
